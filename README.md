# Reacting-The-Coding-Interview

We were inspired to create this web app after months of working on daily coding challenges. 
We thought it would be neat to create a web app that would  strengthen our knowledge and understanding in the process of creating a collaborative web app while at the same time integrating our enjoyment to solving coding challenges. 
        For the coding challenges we will be using challenges found in cracking the coding interview. 
From chapters 1, 2 ,3, 4, 8 and  10. 

App Structure 
   You go to the app web page in the first thing that loads is the splash page, followed by the App
      That contains the navbar component side menu component code display component footer component.

Within the side menu whenever a different problem is clicked then a new component is loaded into the code display component.
